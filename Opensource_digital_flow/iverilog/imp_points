SRAM Verilog testbench : 
A synchronous RAM writes data ONLY at the rising edge of the clock.
At that exact rising edge, the RAM samples: Whatever these signals are AT THAT MOMENT, the RAM uses.
Example :
  we = 1;
  rst = 0;
  @(posedge clk)
  addr = address;
  wrdata = data_tmp;
  we = 0;
Comments :
  we     = 1, addr   = OLD_VALUE   (whatever was there before), wrdata = OLD_VALUE
